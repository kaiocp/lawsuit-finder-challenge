# API

## Architecture

I choose **Model-View-Controller** as the architecture pattern for this project since it separates code responsabilities and helps with organization.
## Database
**MongoDB** was the chosen database since it's a NoSQL and there's no need to establish relationships between tables, all we need is a Lawsuits collection in order to store the data.
## Dependencies
I've decided to use **express** since it's a very lightweight backend framework and all that this API has to provide is a get route in order for the client side to render the lawsuits.

I had to install **mongoose** to manage the connection with MongoDB.

**Nodemon** is being used as a dev dependecy since it helps with productivity.

The moment I started to make requests from the client side I got some cross-origin errors, which is the reason why I had to install **Cors** afterwards.

## Routes

There are three routes in this API. The first one returns all lawsuits, the second one return a lawsuit based on its court and CNJ identifier and the third one post a lawsuit to the API. 

Since all we need in the client side is to return a single lawsuit based on a search field put, patch and delete HTTP methods weren't implemented.

# Client

## Architecture

I've decided to use **TypeScript** as a React template for this project. Beyond the many other benefits of cast typing, as we'll be making http requests to an API, TS will give us the benefit of using interfaces to the objects that will be rendered, avoiding unexpected behaviors.

## Dependencies
For making HTTP requests this projects uses **Axios** over Fetch API, since it supports olders browsers and helps with JSON data transformation, among many other benefits.

I'm also using **Sass** as a CSS pre-processor to increase productivity for styling components.

I've also decided to use **CSS Reset** to avoid inconsistent stylization.

**CSS Modules** are also being used to avoid further conflicts between stylesheets.

To make the input where the user will type the CNJ identifier to find a lawsuit I've decided to use **InputMask** to put a mask on this input.

## Styles
As this is a service that is related to a field known for being more "serious" I've decided to go with a sober color palette (https://coolors.co/palette/0c101b-0d1f35-102a45-c2c2c2-eaeaeb-d39b22) and typographies (Montserrat and OpenSans).
